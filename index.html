<h1>COSMOSPORIA</h1>

<p><i>Cosmosporia</i> - neologism derived from the Greek roots <i>kosmos (divine order, universe)</i> and <i>spora (to spread, to sow)</i>. The establishment
of a spacefaring civilization.</p>

<p><i>Cosmosporia</i> is a work-in-progress game for PC made with the Godot engine. In it, the player is tasked with managing a space program whose purpose
is to bring humanity into space, to the planets and eventually to the stars beyond. The focus is on designing space stations, surface bases, modular ships
and more. Balance your resources between keeping stations supplied and expanding new ones. Coordinate transferring materials between stations and bases,
mine asteroids, harvest the energies of the void, research new technologies, bend space, unlock the secrets of the universe.</p>

<p>...or so is the plan. This is a passion project I'm working on in my free time. Progress will be incremental and sporadic. There is no official release
date nor roadmap. And yet, as the Qurubi say, the work must never end...</p>

<p>Keep an eye on this website for updates and development logs. Until then...</p>
