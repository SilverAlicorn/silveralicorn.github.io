[{"body":"Cosmosporia - neologism derived from the Greek roots kosmos (divine order, universe) and spora (to spread, to sow). The establishment of a spacefaring civilization.\nCosmosporia is a work-in-progress game for PC made with the Godot engine. In it, the player is tasked with managing a space program whose purpose is to bring humanity into space, to the planets and eventually to the stars beyond. The focus is on designing space stations, surface bases, modular ships and more. Balance your resources between keeping stations supplied and expanding new ones. Coordinate transferring materials between stations and bases, mine asteroids, harvest the energies of the void, research new technologies, bend space, unlock the secrets of the universe.\n\u0026hellip;or so is the plan. This is a passion project I\u0026rsquo;m working on in my free time. Progress will be incremental and sporadic. There is no official release date nor roadmap. And yet, as the Qurubi say, the work must never end\u0026hellip;\nKeep an eye on this website for updates and development logs. Until then\u0026hellip;\n","link":"https://cosmosporia.com/welcome/","section":"","title":"Welcome"},{"body":"🛰Build Modular Space Stations Stations are the heart of the game. Start with a core module and send up more to expand. Utility modules provide habitation, power and storage. Science modules enable researching new technologies to build better stations and improve logistics to reach further and further from the home world.\n👩‍🚀👨‍🚀Recruit \u0026lsquo;Nauts \u0026lsquo;Nauts (both cosmo- and astro-) keep your stations up and running. Ensure they have enough supplies, and make sure to change them out frequently to keep them healthy and ready for the next expedition.\n🚀Manage Your Logistics Modules have to come from somewhere! Production facilities and launch sites are limited, so plan carefully to keep your stations supplied, and try to find space in the schedule to launch new modules as well. Inter-station logistics become available mid-game, so you can skip hauling matter up and down the gravity well.\n🌑Moon Bases and Asteroids Take the plunge and become truly spaceborne. Establish surface bases or capture asteroids to mine them for materials.\n🪐🌠🌌To the Planets and Beyond Build modular ships and send them to the outer planets. Research new technologies to adapt better to space, or to adapt space to you. Terraform worlds? Build megastructures? Travel to other stars? Space holds many possibilities!\n","link":"https://cosmosporia.com/game/","section":"","title":"-=About the Game=-"},{"body":"\nA Game About Space Welcome to the Cosmosporia website!
